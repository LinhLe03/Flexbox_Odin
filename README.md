# Flexbox_Odin

This folder contains my answers for flexbox exercises from The Odin Project.

They range from grouping links on either side of a footer, to evenly distributing the space between contents, or creating a Google-like page and creating a Holy Grail layout of flexbox (with header at the top, a left sidebar, a main section on the right, and the footer being pushed to bottom)
